# ezCache
Have you ever wanted to access a link but its broken or currently down?  
Google used to have a very handy tool to get that link, called google cached.  
As my mental health started deteriorating and falling apart, so did Google...   
The legendary tech still lives on, fading into obscurity, known only to those go past the first page of the search([Stack overflow](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/15633/how-to-modify-a-url-to-get-a-google-cached-version-of-page)).  

In an effort to make things slightly better in this cruel and unfeeling world, I turned the caching URL transformation into a javascript bookmarklet.  
When you use it, it will let you cache a URL you paste into it, otherwise if you click it and hit enter it will cache the current URL  
## Usage
Click on the bookmarklet.

Or type enter/click ok redirected to the current page:  

Otherwise cancel to do nothing. 
## Installation
